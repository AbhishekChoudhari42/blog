                    <h3>“Creativity is the ability to introduce order into the randomness of nature” <br> – Eric Hoffer </h3> <br>
                </div>
            
                
                
                
                <h3>Well many of us think of creativity as something which is specifically associated with human being’s  and it may be true to a certain extent at least today it’s not the ability which a computer possesses , but even if computers cannot themselves create something, they can still be used as tools to create something beautiful and in this blog post I’ll try to explain to you a simple example of what that might look like. </h3>
                <br>
                <h3><span> So, what exactly is Generative Art?</span> <br>
                    Generative Art is a form of art in which beautiful patterns, images, forms are made by using certain algorithms. And today we will be creating something which is called a flow field and then we will add some reflections to it to create a symmetrical pattern. We will be using the P5.js library which is a JavaScript library for making digital sketches.
                    </h3>
             

                <!-- blog images -->
               
                <h3>So let’s get started. <br>
                    Firstly we’ll have to include the CDN link of the P5.js library in our project.
                    </h3>

                    </div>
                    <h3>And that’s all we need to add in our html file. <br></h3>

                <h3>Then you can add some styling to the html to center the canvas which we will be creating</h3>
                
                <div class="blog-image">
                    <img src="./blog-assets/carbon (2).png" alt="">
                </div>
                
                <br> <h3>Now we will start with JavaScript </h3>
                <h3>
                    We will begin by initializing the CanvasWidth and CanvasHeight variable. <br> 
                    Then well declare the points array  and a variable called scale the value of scale can be adjusted according to your liking ( try taking different values and see the results)
                </h3>
               <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="./blog-assets/js1.png" alt="">
            </div>
<h3>In the setup function we will create a canvas with width equal to CanvasWidth and height equal to CanvasHeight 
    </h3>

    <br>
    <h3>Background colour will be black,
    Set the angle mode to degrees and noise detail to 1 and pixel density as 1 <br><br>
                Initialize the variable density according to your preference but higher density may pose some performance issues and may lag so we will keep it at 64. <br><br>
                The space variable  is just  the distance between the points <br> 
            </h3>
   
             
           
            <div class="blog-image">

            </div>
            <h3>

               
               
                
                After this a nested for loop will be required to initialize the positions of all the points( it will look like a 2D matrix) <br><br>
                <div class="blog-image">
                    <img src="./blog-assets/initiate.png" alt="">
                </div>
                Just so that it does not remain uniform we will just add a bit of randomness to it using the random() function <br><br>
                <div class="blog-image">
                    <img src="./blog-assets/offset.png" alt="">
                </div>
               
                This completes our setup, now we need update the positions of these points continuously using the draw function in order to give it a flow field like effect <br>


               
            </h3>


            <!-- draww -->
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>The <span>draw( )</span> function runs continuously, updates at each frame</h3>

           
               

            <h3>We will initialise varibale cw as CanvasWidth and ch as canvasHeight</h3>
           <br>
           <h3>
               The <span>noStroke( ) </span> function removes the stroke from the ellipse which we will be drawing 
           </h3>


            <div class="blog-image">
                <img src="./blog-assets/draw1.png" alt="">
            </div>

            <h3> 
            We will run a for loop to draw all the points in the array 
                
            </h3>
            <br>
            <h3> 
               The colour mapping is done according to the position of the points on the canvas 
               
                    
                </h3>
                <br>

<h3>And at last we get a flow field with fourfold symmetry</h3>
